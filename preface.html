<p>Why, oh why, would anyone be interested in Leo? After all, Emacs and Vim are
superb text editors, and Visual Studio and Eclipse are great IDE&#8217;s. How can Leo
possibly compete with such strong competition? What does Leo offer that these
other tools don&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Leo does have something unique to offer&#8211;something missing from Emacs,Vim,
Visual Studio and Eclipse. Leo&#8217;s users often speak of an Aha! moment when they
understand what this &#8216;something&#8217; is. The Aha! arises from considering programs,
design and data in a new light. You might call this &#8216;The Leo Way&#8217;. In essence,
Leo shows that computer programs, designs and data are <em>not</em>, after all, mostly
about text. Yes, people usually <em>express</em> programs, designs and data as text.
Yes, people manipulate programs, designs and data <em>using</em> text, but <em>text is not
the whole story</em>.</p>
<p>In The Leo Way, text is simply a manifestation (a shadow) of something more
fundamental. That &#8216;something else&#8217; might be called &#8216;organization&#8217; or &#8216;structure&#8217;
or &#8216;views&#8217; or even &#8216;architecture&#8217;. However, let us use the term <strong>node</strong> to
represent the fundamental unit of structure in Leo. We&#8217;ll see why in a moment.</p>
<p>In architectural terms, nodes are bricks that make up a building. In computer
programming terms, nodes make up methods, classes, files and entire
applications. So the term &#8216;node&#8217; does <em>not</em> have a fixed meaning&#8211;it is simply a
unit of organization. Any node can be built from other nodes, and any node can
be used by any other node. Leo represent nodes directly, as nodes (headlines) in
an outline. An outline node contains a headline and body text. The <strong>outline
pane</strong> shows all headlines; the <strong>body pane</strong> shows the body text of the
presently selected node.</p>
<div class="section" id="outline-structure-is-real-data">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Outline structure is real data</a><a class="headerlink" href="#outline-structure-is-real-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To repeat: the fundamental unit in Leo is <em>not</em> text. True, headlines and body
<em>consist</em> of text, but a node is just not text, it is a true (Python) object.
This means several specific things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Because nodes are true objects, Leo commands understand what a node is, and
where a node fits into the entire outline. I&#8217;ll say more about outline
organization soon, but let me give an example. Every node has exactly one
parent node, (except for top-level nodes that have no parents) and every node
has zero or more children and zero or more siblings. A node&#8217;s parent,
children and siblings are real properties of the node, <em>completely
independent</em> of the node&#8217;s headline or body text. Furthermore, any of Leo&#8217;s
commands (or user-written scripts or plugins, the big sisters of user
scripts.) can <em>easily</em> access the all aspects of an outline <em>without</em> having
to parse any text whatsoever. Commands, scripts and plugins can easily do the
following: get the root of the outline, the presently selected node in the
outline, the parent, siblings, children or descendants of any node in the
outline, etc., etc. Commands, scripts and plugins can easily insert, delete
or move nodes, and can alter the headline or body text in any node. All this
<em>without</em> parsing text.</li>
<li>Having nodes be true objects means that commands scripts and plugins can
treat the headline text as <em>something truly different from</em> body text. The
natural interpretation of headline text is as a description of the body text.
This is important! Headlines often control Leo&#8217;s commands. For example,
headlines that start with &#64;file, &#64;asis, &#64;auto, etc. serve to guide and
control Leo&#8217;s read and write commands. Headlines that start with &#64;test,
&#64;suite and &#64;mark-for-unit-tests guide Leo&#8217;s unit testing commands. Moreover,
it is easy to create new conventions for headlines that control user-written
scripts or plugins. For example, plugins define specific meanings for
headlines that start with &#64;url, &#64;rst, &#64;bookmark, &#64;slideshow, etc., etc. So
the separation of headline and body text, <strong>as true components of a node
object</strong>, is a very big deal.</li>
<li>One application of these ideas deserves special mention. Leo&#8217;s scripting
plugin provides support for &#64;button nodes. The headline is &#64;button
&lt;command-name&gt;. The body text contains a script. When Leo opens a Leo
outline, each &#64;button node creates a command and an icon. Clicking the icon
(or executing the command) applies the script in the &#64;button node <strong>to the
presently selected outline</strong>. That is, the script is executed in a context in
which it is easy to get access to all aspects of the outline in which the
script is embedded. This is a major advance in scripting. It allows you to
&#8216;bring scripts to data&#8217;, i.e., any part of an outline. In particular, it is
very easy to create <strong>editing scripts</strong> that automate what would otherwise be
boring and repetitive editing tasks.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leo-outlines-aren-t-your-average-outline">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Leo outlines aren&#8217;t your average outline</a><a class="headerlink" href="#leo-outlines-aren-t-your-average-outline" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Earlier I said that <em>any</em> node can be built from other nodes, and <em>any</em> node can
be used by any other node. It takes a very special kind of outline for this to
be possible. In a typical outline, such as Emacs outline mode, for example,
nodes appear exactly once in the outline. This makes it impossible to &#8216;reuse&#8217;
nodes in multiple places. Leo removes that limitation: any outline node can be
<strong>cloned</strong>, and clones can appear in as many places in an outline as you like.
Although clones may look distinct on the screen, at the data level
<strong>each clone is exactly the same node</strong>.</p>
<p>Earlier I said that you can think of nodes as representing &#8216;organization&#8217; or
&#8216;structure&#8217; or &#8216;views&#8217; or even &#8216;architecture&#8217;. Clones are the crucial feature
that allows this point of view. For example, we can build up multiple &#8216;views&#8217; of
data in an outline using clones as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a &#8216;view node&#8217; that will represent a <em>user-specified</em> view.</li>
<li>Clone all nodes that are to be part of the view, and move them so that each
clone is a child of the view node.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s about all there is to it. The view node, and its children <em>is</em> a new view
of the outline. This notion of &#8216;view&#8217; is so important that Leo supports it
directly. Leo&#8217;s <strong>chapters</strong> are simply views created as I have just described.
When you select one chapter, you only see the nodes of that chapter in Leo&#8217;s
outline pane.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusions-encouragements">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Conclusions &amp; encouragements</a><a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions-encouragements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So Leo offers a new way to understand, organize and manipulate <em>any</em> kind of
complex data, including computer programs, <em>designs</em> of computer programs, web
sites, personal data, whatever. The Aha that I invite you to experience is this:
Outlines are more than mere eye candy. Having organization be real data creates
an entirely new dimension, literally and figuratively, in computer programming,
computer design and data organization, including web-site design, database
design, etc. Leo&#8217;s commands use headline and body text in many creative ways. So
can you and your scripts. It&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s fun, and it&#8217;s revolutionary.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about it, except for some words of caution and advice:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Leo has been under active development for over 10 years. The new world
created by nodes is rich and varied. You won&#8217;t learn it all in a day or so.
Please be patient. Start by learning Leo&#8217;s basic features as explained in the
tutorial. You can learn more advanced features later.</li>
<li>Those of you who are comfortable with Emacs should feel pretty much at home
with Leo. Leo has shamelessly stolen the best features of Emacs, including
the minibuffer and many Emacs-like commands.</li>
<li>For those of you who are <em>not</em> comfortable with Emacs, please understand that
you do <em>not</em> need to understand all of Leo&#8217;s commands in order to use Leo.
Start by ignoring the minibuffer. Later, the minibuffer can become your
friend, but you can get the Aha! without it.</li>
