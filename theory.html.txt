Clones
++++++

New in Leo 4.7. All clones of a node **are the same node**. This is the
so-called **one-node** world. In this world, vnodes represent data, generators
and positions represent the location of the data in an outline.  This is a much
simpler world than all previous data representations.

In Leo versions 4.2 to 4.6 clones were represented by sharing **tnodes**. Cloned
vnodes shared the same tnode. This shared tnode represented the entire shared
subtree of both clones. Thus, the _firstChild link had to reside in
*tnodes*, not *vnodes*.

Prior to Leo version 4.2, Leo duplicated all the descendants of vnode v when
cloning v. This created many complications that were removed in the shared tnode
world. In particular, in the shared tnode scheme a vnode v is cloned if and only
if len(v.vnodeList) > 1.

Drawing and events
++++++++++++++++++

Leo must redraw the outline pane when commands are executed and as the result of mouse and keyboard events.
The main challenges are eliminating flicker and handling events properly.
These topics are interrelated.

**Eliminating flicker**. Leo must update the outline pane with minimum flicker.
Various versions of Leo have approached this problem in different ways. The
drawing code in leo.py is robust, flexible, relatively simple and should work in
almost any conceivable environment. Leo assumes that all code that changes the
outline pane will be enclosed in matching calls to the c.beginUpdate and
c.endUpdate methods of the Commands class. c.beginUpdate() inhibits drawing
until the matching c.endUpdate(). These calls may be nested; only the outermost
call to c.endUpdate() calls c.redraw() to force a redraw of the outline pane.

Code may call c.endUpdate(flag) instead of c.endUpdate(). Leo redraws
the screen only if flag is true. This allows code to suppress redrawing entirely
when needed. For example, here is how the idle_body_key event handler in
leoTree.py conditionally redraws the outline pane::

	redraw_flag = false
  	c.beginUpdate()
	val = v.computeIcon()
	if val != v.iconVal:
		v.iconVal = val
		redraw_flag = true
	c.endUpdate(redraw_flag) # redraw only if necessary

The leoTree class redraws all icons automatically when c.redraw() is called.
This is a major simplification compared to previous versions of Leo. The entire
machinery of drawing icons in the vnode class has been eliminated. The
v.computeIcon method tells what the icon should be. The v.iconVal ivar
tells what the present icon is. The event handler simply compares these two
values and sets redraw_flag if they don't match.

**Handling events.** Besides redrawing the screen, Leo must handle events or
commands that change the text in the outline or body panes.

The leoTree class contains all the event handlers for the body and outline
panes. The actual work is done in the idle_head_key and idle_body_key methods.
These routines are surprisingly complex; they must handle all the tasks
mentioned above, as well as others. The idle_head_key and idle_body_key methods
should not be called outside the leoTree class. However, it often happens that
code that handles user commands must simulate an event. That is, the code needs
to indicate that headline or body text has changed so that the screen may be
redrawn properly. The leoTree class defines the following simplified event
handlers: onBodyChanged, onBodyWillChange, onBodyKey, onHeadChanged and
onHeadlineKey. Commanders and subcommanders call these event handlers to
indicate that a command has changed, or will change, the headline or body text.
Calling event handlers rather than c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate ensures that
the outline pane is redrawn only when needed.

Find and change commands
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The find and change commands are tricky; there are many details that must be
handled properly. The following principles govern the LeoFind class:

1.  Find and Change commands initialize themselves using only the state of the
    present Leo window. In particular, the Find class must not save internal
    state information from one invocation to the next. This means that when the
    user changes the nodes, or selects new text in headline or body text, those
    changes will affect the next invocation of any Find or Change command.
    Failure to follow this principle caused all kinds of problems in the Borland
    and Macintosh codes. There is one exception to this rule: we must remember
    where interactive wrapped searches start. This principle simplifies the code
    because most ivars do not persist. However, each command must ensure that
    the Leo window is left in a state suitable for restarting the incremental
    (interactive) Find and Change commands. Details of initialization are
    discussed below.

2.  The Find and Change commands must not change the state of the outline or body
    pane during execution. That would cause severe flashing and slow down the
    commands a great deal. In particular, the c.selectPosition and c.editPosition
    methods must not be called while looking for matches.

3.  When incremental Find or Change commands succeed they must leave the Leo
    window in the proper state to execute another incremental command. We
    restore the Leo window as it was on entry whenever an incremental search
    fails and after any Find All and Change All command. Initialization involves
    setting the self.c, self.v, self.in_headline, self.wrapping and
    self.s_text ivars.

Setting self.in_headline is tricky; we must be sure to retain the state of the
outline pane until initialization is complete. Initializing the Find All and
Change All commands is much easier because such initialization does not depend
on the state of the Leo window. Using the same kind of text widget for both
headlines and body text results in a huge simplification of the code.

Indeed, the searching code does not know whether it is searching headline or
body text. The search code knows only that self.s_text is a text widget that
contains the text to be searched or changed and the insert and sel attributes
of self.search_text indicate the range of text to be searched. Searching
headline and body text simultaneously is complicated. The selectNextVnode()
method handles the many details involved by setting self.s_text and its insert
and sel attributes.

Key handling
++++++++++++

The following three sections deal with different aspects of how Leo handle's
keystrokes that the user types. This is the most complex code in Leo.

Key domains
***********

Leo's key-handling code has almost nothing to do with supporting multiple guis.
Rather, the key-handling code is complex because it must deal with the following
four fundamentally different problem domains.

Domain 1: Parsing user bindings in @keys, @mode and @shortcut nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this domain, complexity arises from allowing the user a variety of
*equivalent* ways of specifying bindings. Furthermore, this domain allows the
user to specify modes and per-pane bindings. Thus, all these complexities are
unavoidable.

Domain 2: Maintaining and using binding tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The result of parsing user bindings are a set of binding tables. These tables
are complex, but we need not go into details here because only one method,
k.masterKeyHandler (and its helper, getPaneBinding) uses the tables.

The only thing we have to remember about the binding tables is that bindings are
expressed in terms of so-called **strokes**.  Strokes are the "official" form of
every user binding.  The essential property of a stroke is that it contains
*all* the information required to handle the stroke: Leo can unambiguously
determine exactly what a stroke means and what bindings are in effect for a
stroke.  If necessary, Leo can correctly insert the proper character
*corresponding* to the stroke into any text widget. 

This correspondence (association) between the stroke and the actual
character to be inserted into text widgets is crucial.  This
correspondence is created in the next domain.

Anticipating a bit, for any incoming key event, event.stroke is the
stroke, and event.char is the character (if any) that *might*
(depending on bindings) be inserted into text widgets.

**New in Leo 4.9**: k.stroke2char calculates the to-be-inserted char from
any stroke.

Domain 3: Translating incoming key events into standard events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The eventFilter method in qtGui.py creates leoKeyEvent objects.  Turning "raw"
Qt key events into leoKeyEvents is unavoidably complicated because eventFilter
(and its allies) **must** carefully compute the stroke corresponding to the raw
key event.  There is no way around this requirement if Leo's binding machinery
in domain 2 is to work.  This code has been stable for a long time.

Domain 4: Printing key bindings in a human-readable format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's important not to forget this domain: there are some situations in which we
want to represent '\b','\r','\n' and '\t' as 'BackSpace','Linefeed','Return' and
'Tab'.

Key bindings
************

There are two kinds of bindings, gui bindings and pane bindings.

**Gui bindings** are the actual binding as seen by  whatever gui is in effect.
Leo binds every key that has a binding to k.masterKeyHander.

At present Leo makes gui bindings in several places, all equivalent.
Bindings are made to callbacks, all of which have this form::

     def callback(event=None,k=k,stroke=stroke):
        return k.masterKeyHandler(event,stroke)

As a result, changing gui bindings actually has no effect whatever.
It would be clearer to have a single place to make these bindings...

In any case, the purpose of these callbacks is to capture the value of 'stroke' so
that it can be passed to k.masterKeyHandler.
This relieves k.masterKeyHandler of the impossible task of computing the stroke from the event.

**Important**:  No function argument is ever passed to k.masterKeyHandler from these callbacks,
because k.masterKeyHandler binds keys to command handlers as described next.

**Pane bindings** are bindings represented by various Python dictionaries in the
keyHandlerClass (see below). k.masterKeyHandler and its helpers use these
dictionaries to call the proper command or mode handler. This logic is hairy,
but it is completely separate from the gui binding logic.

Here are the dictionaries that k.masterKeyHandler uses:

- c.commandsDict:
  Keys are minibuffer command names; values are functions f.

- k.inverseCommandsDict:
  Keys are f.__name__l values are emacs command names.

- k.bindingsDict:
  Keys are shortcuts; values are *lists* of g.bunch(func,name,warningGiven).

- k.masterBindingsDict:
  Keys are pane names: 'all','text',etc. or mode names.
  Values are dicts:  keys are strokes; values are g.Bunch(commandName,func,pane,stroke).

- k.modeWidgetsDict:
  Keys are mode names; values are lists of widgets to which bindings have been made.

- k.settingsNameDict:
  Keys are lowercase settings; values are 'real' Tk key specifiers.
  Important: this table has no inverse.

- inverseBindingDict:
  This is *not* an ivar; it is computed by k.computeInverseBindingDict().
  Keys are emacs command names; values are *lists* of shortcuts.

Handling key events
*******************

All events are key events
=========================

All event objects passed around Leo are *key* event objects. Taking a look at
the eventFilter method, we see clearly see that *only* key events ever get
passed to Leo's core. All other events are handled by Qt-specific event
handlers.

As can be seen, these non-key events *can* be passed to Leo, but only as the
event arg in g.doHook (!) At present, no plugin ever calls k.masterKeyHandler.
The only call to k.masterKeyHandler in qtGui.py is the expected call in
eventFilter.

There are other calls to k.masterKeyHandler in Leo's core, but we can prove (by
induction, if you will), that all events passed to k.masterKeyHandler are proper
leoKeyEvent objects.

c.check_event
=============

The essential invariant is that the events passed to Leo's core methods really
are leoKeyEvent objects created by qtGui.py.  Rather than asserting this
invariant, the code will contains calls to c.check_event in essential places. 
c.check_event is a "relaxed" place to do as much error checking is needed.  In
particular, running the unit tests calls c.check_event many times. 

c.check_event is a happy "accident".  It turns out to be the essential
consistency check that continually verifies that the Qt event methods are
delivering the expected keys to k.masterKeyHandler.

Nodes
+++++

The vnode class is Leo's fundamental model class. A **vnode** represents the
data represented by headlines. As of Leo 4.7, all clones of a node are in fact
**exactly the same node**.

The vnode contains **all** data associated with a node. A vnode contains
headline text, body text, and **user attributes**, uA's for short.

Because Leo has unlimited Undo commands, Leo deletes vnodes only when a window
closes. Leo deletes nodes indirectly using destroy methods. Several classes,
including the vnode, leoFrame and leoTree classes, have destroy methods. destroy
methods merely clear links so that Python's reference counting mechanisms will
eventually delete vnodes and other data when a window closes.

Leo's XML file format uses **tx** and **t** attributes to associate <v> elements
with <t> elements. <v> elements represent nodes. <t> elements represent the body
text of nodes. This is a (somewhat dubious) space optimization. The values of tx
and t attributes are **gnx's** (global node indices). These indices do not
change once a node has created.

Overview
++++++++

All versions of Leo are organized as a collection of classes. The general
organization of Leo has remained remarkably stable throughout all versions of
Leo, although the names of classes are different in different versions.
Smalltalk's Model/View/Controller terminology is a good way think about Leo's
classes. **Model classes** represent the fundamental data. The vnode
class is Leo's primary model class.

**View classes** draw the screen. The main view classes are leoFrame.py and
leoTree.py. The colorizer class in leoColor.py handles syntax coloring in the
body pane. Leo's view classes know about data stored in the vnode class. Most
events (keystrokes and mouse actions) in the outline and body pane are handled
in the leoTree class. The leoFrame class also creates the Leo window, including
menus, and dispatches the appropriate members of the controller classes in
response to menu commands.

**Controller classes** (aka commanders) control the application. In Leo,
controllers mostly handle menu commands. Commanders create subcommanders to
handle complex commands. The atFile class reads and writes files derived from
\@file trees. The LeoFind class handles the Find and Change commands. The
leoImportCommands class handles the Import and Export commands, and the undoer
class handles the Undo command. Other classes could be considered controller
classes.

Each Leo window has its own commander and subcommanders. Subcommanders are not
subclasses of their commander. Instead, subcommanders know the commander that
created them, and call that commander as needed. Commanders and subcommanders
call the model and view classes as needed. For example, the Commands class
handles outline commands. To move a headline, the commander for the window calls
a vnode move routine to alter the data, then calls the view class to redraw the
screen based on the new data.

A singleton instance of the **LeoApp** class represents the application itself.
All code uses the app() global function to gain access to this singleton member.
The ivars of the LeoApp object are the equivalent of Leo's global variables.
leo.py uses no global Python variables, except the gApp variable returned by
app(). leoGlobals.py defines all application constants. Naturally, most
constants are local to the class that uses them.

Several classes combine aspects of model, view and controller. For example, the
**LeoPrefs** class represents user preferences (model), the Preference Panel
(view) and the Preferences menu command (controller). Similarly, the **LeoFind**
class represents find settings, the Find/Change dialog, and the Find/Change
commands.

We use the following convention throughout this documentation. Any variable
named c is a commander, i.e., an instance of the Commands class in
leoCommands.py. Variables named v are vnodes. These classes are defined in
leoNodes.py.

Unicode
+++++++

Leo uses unicode objects in vnodes to denote headline and body text.
Note that unicode strings have no encoding; only plain strings have encodings.
This means that once an (encoded) plain string has been converted to a unicode
string it doesn't matter how the unicode string was created. This is the key
that makes Leo's new code robust: internally Leo never has to worry about
encodings. Encoding matter only when encoded strings are converted to and from
Unicode. This happens when Leo reads or writes files.

Python expressions that mix unicode strings u and plain strings s, like one of these::

	u + s
	u == s
	u[5] == s[2:]

are promoted to unicode objects using the "system encoding". This encoding
should never be changed, but we can't assume that we know what it is, so for
safety we should assume the most restrictive encoding, namely "ascii". With this
assumption, Leo's code can't throw an exception during these promotions provided
that: 

- Leo converts all text to unicode when Leo reads files or gets text from
  text widgets.

- All string literals in Leo's code have only ascii characters.

Unlimited undo
++++++++++++++

Unlimited undo is straightforward; it merely requires that all commands that
affect the outline or body text must be undoable. In other words, everything
that affects the outline or body text must be remembered. We may think of all
the actions that may be Undone or Redone as a string of beads (undo nodes).

Undoing an operation moves backwards to the next bead; redoing an operation moves
forwards to the next bead. A bead pointer points to the present bead. The bead
pointer points in front of the first bead when Undo is disabled. The bead
pointer points at the last bead when Redo is disabled. An undo node is a Python
dictionary containing all information needed to undo or redo the operation. The
Undo command uses the present bead to undo the action, then moves the bead
pointer backwards.

The Redo command uses the bead after the present bead to redo the action, then
moves the bead pointer forwards. All undoable operations call setUndoParams() to
create a new bead. The list of beads does not branch; all undoable operations
(except the Undo and Redo commands themselves) delete any beads following the
newly created bead. I did not invent this model of unlimited undo.
I first came across it in the documentation for Apple's Yellow Box classes.
